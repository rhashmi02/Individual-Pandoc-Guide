With Pandoc Guide, you will be able to easily understand how to use Pandoc to automatically convert Word documents to Markdown and vice versa. This guide is much better than the Pandoc documentation as it is easier to understand and gives you specialized information.

## Who was this made for?

This guide was made for future students taking Creating User Documentation so that they can easily complete all assignments in the class that require the use of Pandoc. More specifically, this guide was made for those students taking Computer Science and are using a device running a Windows 10 operating system. With this guide, you will be able to grasp a solid foundation of Pandoc so that you can use it both in this class and for future documentation.
