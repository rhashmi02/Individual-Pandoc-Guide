# Welcome

Hello students in Creating User Documentation! In this class, you will learn how to use Pandoc for different purposes. This guide is intended to walk you through step by step about what Pandoc is, how to download it, and how to use it. The documentation for Pandoc is very messy and difficult to read so this guide will make the process of learning this software much easier. This class has students with a variety of backgrounds ranging from people with more technologically technical backgrounds to skilled writers, but this guide will be focused towards those individuals with more technical backgrounds(CS majors, CMDA majors, etc.) and those using a Windows 10 operating system.
